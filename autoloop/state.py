"""Persistent loop state with atomic writes.

One small JSON file holds everything needed to resume after a crash: the
current phase, the in-flight request (with its request-id, used for duplicate
detection in the conversation itself), the last raw response (so parsing and
execution can be redone idempotently), and the loop counters. Full request /
response texts also go to the append-only transcript (`transcript.py`); the
state file is the recovery source of truth, the transcript is the audit log.

Writes are atomic (temp file + os.replace in the same directory) so a crash
mid-save can never leave a half-written state file.
